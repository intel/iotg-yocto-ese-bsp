SUMMARY = "Enable ALPM for SATA controllers"

DESCRIPTION = "SATA Agressive Low Power Mode (ALPM) \
is a feature to allow power saving policies be configured \
by user through sysfs interface of the SCSI Host. \
SCSI by default is setting max_performance for the policy \
thus we create this udev to update to min_power, for maximum \
power saving."
